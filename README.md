# weatherWindow

Just a window showing weather, from openweathermap API.

It's a personal project on my way learning JS and web dev.

I'm using a free Appid, don't abuse it Please :D.


## How to
To change location, 
* find your city id using the search form from https://openweathermap.org/
* Once on the city page pick the id from the address bar :

```
https://openweathermap.org/city/3469058
```

* copy the numbers (**3469058** in the example above), and paste it into the input

## To-Do

* add instruction on the page
* change weather icon
* work on design
* maybe buy some videos to get rid of the shutterstosk watermark
